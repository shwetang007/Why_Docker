# Why_Docker

Hey there! Welcome to **Why_Docker**—a beginner-friendly guide where you’ll not only learn the basics of Docker but also how I, **SHWETANG**, went through the whole process of figuring it out from scratch.

## Why This Repo?

When I first started learning Docker, I was totally confused about how it fits into web development. So, I decided to document everything I learned in the hopes that it makes someone else's learning journey easier. This repo is a mix of what worked for me and some essential tips to help you use Docker for your web projects.

## What’s Inside?

- **What is Docker, really?**  
  Let’s clear up the confusion about containers and why Docker is such a big deal.
  
- **Setting it up**  
  A simple guide to getting Docker installed on your machine, no fuss.

- **First Steps**  
  I’ll walk you through creating your first Dockerized web app—nothing too complex, just a basic HTML page in a container.

- **The Big Why**  
  Why should you even bother with Docker? I had the same question! Turns out, it makes life *so* much easier when working on web projects, especially when you’re jumping between different environments.

- **Best Practices I Wish I Knew Sooner**  
  A few tips that would have saved me hours of headache early on—like using `.dockerignore` to avoid dragging unnecessary files into the container.

## My Docker Journey

To keep it real, I didn’t understand Docker on Day 1. It took me a few tries, some failed builds, and a lot of Googling. But once I got the hang of it, things just clicked. Now, I use Docker to spin up web projects without worrying about different environments, libraries, or dependencies messing things up. If I could learn it, trust me, you can too!

## Let’s Get Started

So, if you’re new to Docker and want to avoid some of the mistakes I made, this guide is for you. You don’t need to know everything upfront—just follow along, and by the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how Docker can fit into your web development process.

I Suggest you that you first go through the  **Read Me First** to have a detailed understanding of what was the concept behind the use of  Docker

## Heartfelt Thanks
